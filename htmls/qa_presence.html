<p style="font-size: 14px; text-size-adjust: auto;">We need your help in judging whether some facts are present or not present in a short English paragraph.	</p>
    <span style="font-size: 18pt">Congrats! You are qualified! Please read through the following instructions as well as <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B3IlSmkO9fC1QMkxZVBWunYMtiLREhalEJVWzAQcgLs/edit?usp=sharing">this slide deck</a> before you accept any task. </span>

    <button class="collapsible" type="button">Please CLICK and READ the following instruction carefully.

    <div class="instruction">
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 14px; text-size-adjust: auto;">
        In this task, you will be given a list of <strong>question-answer pairs</strong> extracted from the <strong>reference text</strong>.
        Your job is to decide if the <strong>candidate text</strong> contains the information of each question-answer pair.
        Please answer <span style="color: green">'Present'</span> if the information of the question-answer pair can be
        inferred from the candidate text. Otherwise, mark <span style="color: red">'Not Present'</span>.
    </p>

        <strong> <span style="color: red">Importantly,</span> </strong><br>

        1. Question-answer pairs are grouped by <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">their centric verb</span>.  <br>
        2. The reference text is provided only as context when the centric verb or the answer is not self-explanatory. For example, in Example 1 below, "He" in
        the 5th question-answer pair refers to "Juan Arango" in the reference text. However, you should <strong>NOT</strong> replace "something" (or "someone", etc.) in the question
           with information from the reference text. <br>
        3. You can first <strong>convert the question-answer pair into an affirmative statement</strong> and check if the meaning
        of this statement is present in the candidate text or not. For example, the affirmative statement of "What did someone escape from? punishment" is "someone escaped from punishment".<br>
        4. <span style="color: green">'Present'</span> means that the meaning of the fact (question-answer pair)
        is <strong>covered</strong> or <strong>implied</strong> by the candidate text, or can be <strong>inferred</strong> from the
        candidate text, while <strong>the exact format/expression/wording can be different</strong>. In Example 1 below,
        the 8th question-answer is present in the Candidate Text 1 because "A Arango free kick had brought..." implies Arango scored a kick.
        <br>
        5. Please make sure to judge each question-answer pair's presence <strong>individually and independently</strong>. For example, in Example 1 below, the 5th question-answer pair in <span style="color: red">not present</span> in the Candidate Text 2, while the 6th pair is <span style="color: green">present</span>.<br>

        6. Question-answer pairs can have concepts that are <strong>more general</strong> than those in the candidate text. For example, if the fact is "someone is having fun"
        and the candidate text has "John is having fun", then the fact is <span style="color: green">present</span> in the candidate text, whereas "John is having fun" is <span style="color: red">not present</span> in "someone is having fun".<br>
        7. A person or an entity can be referred to differently as long as the meaning is clear. For example, in Example 1 below,
        "The player" in the 8th question-answer pair refers to "Juan Arango", hence, this pair is <span style="color: green">present</span> in the Candidate Text 1.<br>
        8. Overlook minor errors in grammar, punctuation, spelling, or upper case / lower case that do not affect your understanding. <br>
        9. In a few rare cases, the question-answer pair itself is wrong and not aligned with the reference text. You do not need to fix the pair,
        and please still judge whether the meaning of this pair is present in the candidate text.

     <br><br>
        The following examples will help explain the instructions</span>:
    <br>
    <p class="well">
        <strong><span style="color: green">Example 1</span></strong> <br><br>
        <strong>Reference Text:</strong> Juan Arango <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">escaped</span>
        punishment from the referee for <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">biting</span> Jesus Zavela .
        He could <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">face</span> a retrospective punishment for the incident .
        The player had earlier <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">scored</span> a free kick in his team's 4-3 defeat . <br><br>

        <strong>Question-Answer Pairs:</strong> <br>
        1 Who escaped from something? Juan Arango&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        2 What did someone escape from? punishment&nbsp;<br><br>

        3 Who was biting someone? Juan Arango <br>
        4 Who was someone biting? Jesus Zavela <br><br>

        5 Who might face something? He <br>
        6 What might someone face? a retrospective punishment <br>
        7 Why might someone face something? for the incident <br><br>

        8 Who scored something? The player <br>
        9 What did someone score?  a free kick <br>
        10 When did someone score something? earlier <br><br><br>

        <strong>Candidate Text 1:</strong> Club Tijuana lost 4-3 to Monterrey in the Mexican league. Juan Arango was not
        booked but could face a heavy retrospective ban. A Arango free kick had brought his team level at 2-2. <br><br>
        1 Who escaped from something? Juan Arango &nbsp;&nbsp;  <span style="color: green">Present</span>, because "not booked" has the same meaning as "escaped". <br>
        2 What did someone escape from? punishment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">Present</span>, because "punishment" is a more general concept of "ban". <br><br>
        3 Who was biting someone? Juan Arango &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: red">Not Present</span>, because there is nothing related to "biting" in the candidate text.<br>
        4 Who was someone biting? Jesus Zavela &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red">Not Present</span>, because there is nothing related to "biting" in the candidate text.<br><br>
        5 Who might face something? He &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green">Present</span>, because "He" is more general than
           "Juan Arango", and in the reference text "He" refers to "Juan Arango".<br>
        6 What might someone face? a retrospective punishment &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green">Present</span>, because "punishment" is a more general concept of "ban".<br>
        7 Why might someone face something? for the incident &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red">Not Present</span>, because the candidate text does not mention why Arango could face a ban.<br><br>
        8 Who scored something? The player &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green">Present</span>, because "A Arango free kick had brought his team..." indicates that Arango scored a free kick, and "The player" refers to Arango in the reference text<br>
        9 What did someone score?  a free kick &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green">Present</span>, because "A Arango free kick had brought his team..." indicates that Arango scored a free kick.<br>
        10 When did someone score something? earlier &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red">Not Present</span>, because there is no information about "earlier" in the candidate text. <br><br><br>

        <strong>Candidate Text 2:</strong> Jesus Zavela could face a heavy retrospective ban. <br><br>
       5 Who might face something? He &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: red">Not Present</span>, because even if "He" is more general than
           "Jesus Zavela", in the reference text "He" refers to "Juan Arango" instead of "Jesus Zavela".<br>
       6 What might someone face? a retrospective punishment &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green">Present</span>, because "punishment" is a more general concept of "ban".<br>
