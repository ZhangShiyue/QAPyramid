<p style="font-size: 14px; text-size-adjust: auto;">We need your help in deconstructing the meanings of verbs in an English sentence into lists of questions and answers. 	</p>

    <p style="font-size: 14px; text-size-adjust: auto;">For each assignment, you will be prompted with <span style="font-weight: 700;">a short English sentence</span>
        with <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">a verb</span>.
        Your task is to <strong><u>write</u> questions and answers</strong> for this verb.
    <br><br>
        This task is the same as what you have done in the qualification test.

    Each <strong>question should be formed </strong>  by filling slots like some examples in the table below. One verb can have multiple questions, please write as many as possible, we leave 5 input spaces for filling in at most 5 questions per verb.
        For any particular verb, if there is more than one possible question that has the same answer, please just write one of them.

        <strong>It is <span style="color: red">IMPORTANT</span> to note that</strong> questions can not contain any detailed information from the
        sentence except for the verb (unless it falls into the two exceptions listed below). Please use "something" and "someone" to replace the actual information.
        See the <del><span style="color: red">red errors</span></del> in the example above.
        The reason behind this is that we want one question-answer pair only contains one verb plus one argument,
        so that it can be one atomic unit of the sentence.
        <br><strong><span style="color: red">Exception 1</span></strong>: It is a phrasal verb, or the word before/after the verb is essential to complete the verb's meaning. For example, "tractors could <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">get</span> stuck in the mud",
        you should write "what could something get stuck in? the mud" instead of "what could something get? stuck in the mud".
        <br><strong><span style="color: red">Exception 2</span></strong>: When the verb is a "Be" verb (is, are, etc.), for example, "this <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">is</span> an example",
    then the question-answer pair "what is something? this" is too vague, please instead write "what is an example? this".
        But when the "Be" verb is followed by a predicative adjective, for example, "he <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">is</span> out on loan", then it
    falls back to the regular setting, please write "who is out? he" and "why is someone out? on loan".

    <br><br>
    Every <strong>answer should be a substring of the sentence</strong> (so you can copy from the sentence).
    Some questions can have multiple answers, please write as many as possible.
    We provide 3 input spaces after each question for you to fill in at most 3 valid answers.
    <br><br>



    <strong>Important Guidelines</strong>: <br>
        1. <strong><span style="color: purple">Correctness</span></strong>: Each question-answer pair must satisfy the litmus test that if you substitute the answer back into the question, the result is a grammatical statement, and it is true according to the sentence given.
    See the <del><span style="color: purple">purple errors</span></del> in the example above. For example, "Who blamed? Protesters" would become Protesters blamed, which is ungrammatical. <br>
        2. <strong><span style="color: orange">Verb-relevance</span></strong>: The answer to a question must pertain to the participants, time, place, reason, etc., of the target verb in the sentence. For example, if the sentence is "He <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: lightgreen">promised</span> to come tomorrow,"
        you should NOT write "When did someone promise to do something? tomorrow", because tomorrow is not the time that he made the promise, but rather the time that he might come.
        See the <del><span style="color: orange">orange errors</span></del> in the example above.
<!--    3. <strong>Exhaustiveness</strong>: You must write as many questions, and as many answers to each question, as possible.  For any particular verb, if there is more than one possible question that has the same answer, please just write one of them.-->
    <br><br>
    <strong>Please note</strong> that <i>your questions will be judged by other annotators, and you must retain an accuracy of 85% in order to remain qualified</i>. Each verb will require you to write at least one question, and <i>you must write 2 or more questions per verb on average in order to remain qualified</i>.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Additional Notes</strong>: <br>
    1. Occasionally, you may get a bolded word that isn't a verb, or is hard or impossible to write questions about. In this case, please note it in the feedback and do your best to come up with one question, even if it is nonsensical. While it will count against your accuracy, this case is rare enough that it shouldn't matter. <br>
    2. If the sentence has grammatical errors or is not a complete sentence, please write questions and answers that are appropriate to the sentence's meaning to the best of your ability.
